        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>In this task, you will be evaluating four different responses to the same dialogue context. <br>
            Your job is to rate how <b>natural the flow</b> of each response was, how <b>consistent and on-topic</b> each response was, and the <b>overall quality</b> of each response. <br>
            Please rate each response separately.</p>
